# /graphiti-mode - Switch to Graphiti Operations Tracking

Activate specialized knowledge graph operations and data analysis tracking mode.

## Usage
```
/graphiti-mode
```

## Implementation
This command switches the current session to Graphiti operations tracking mode:

**Activates Graphiti-Specific Tracking:**
- Knowledge graph schema design and entity modeling
- Neo4j performance optimization and query tuning
- Temporal relationship analysis and graph traversal
- Data ingestion pipelines and entity extraction
- Graph analytics and relationship discovery

**Auto-Tracking Behaviors:**
- `GRAPHITI OPS: [operation] - [graph modification] - [performance impact]`
- `KNOWLEDGE MODELING: [entity type] - [relationships] - [temporal context]`
- `GRAPH ANALYTICS: [analysis type] - [patterns discovered] - [insights]`
- `NEO4J OPTIMIZATION: [query/config] - [performance improvement] - [metrics]`
- `DATA PIPELINE: [source] - [transformation] - [graph integration]`

**Session Management:**
- Session starts logged as Graphiti operations context
- Knowledge graph modifications automatically tracked
- Performance optimizations recorded with metrics
- Session conclusions summarize graph changes and analytical insights

Use `/dev-mode` or `/islamic-mode` to switch to other tracking contexts.
