# /track-dev - Force Development Tracking

Manually trigger development and technical tracking for specific activities.

## Usage
```
/track-dev "technical decision or solution"
/track-dev "infrastructure change or problem resolution"
/track-dev "code modification description"
```

## Examples
```
/track-dev "Chose Docker over local installation for better isolation"
/track-dev "Fixed Neo4j connection timeout by increasing memory allocation"
/track-dev "Updated slash commands to support context-aware tracking"
```

## Implementation
This command forces development tracking regardless of current mode:

**Direct Knowledge Graph Storage:**
- `DEVELOPMENT: [context] - [technical choice/solution] - [rationale]`
- `CODE CHANGE: [file] - [modification description] - [purpose/context]`
- `PROBLEM SOLVED: [context] - [issue] - [solution applied]`
- `INFRASTRUCTURE: [component] - [configuration change] - [impact]`
- `ARCHITECTURE DECISION: [choice] - [alternatives considered] - [rationale]`

**Use Cases:**
- Recording technical decisions during Islamic research sessions
- Forcing development tracking without switching modes
- Manual logging of infrastructure changes
- Documenting problem resolutions in any context
