# /track-graphiti - Force Graphiti Operations Tracking

Manually trigger knowledge graph operations tracking for specific activities.

## Usage
```
/track-graphiti "graph operation or modification"
/track-graphiti "Neo4j optimization or query improvement"
/track-graphiti "knowledge modeling insight"
```

## Examples
```
/track-graphiti "Created new temporal relationship index for Islamic entities"
/track-graphiti "Optimized graph traversal query reducing response time from 2s to 200ms"
/track-graphiti "Designed entity model for hadith chain relationships"
```

## Implementation
This command forces Graphiti operations tracking regardless of current mode:

**Direct Knowledge Graph Storage:**
- `GRAPHITI OPS: [operation] - [graph modification] - [performance impact]`
- `KNOWLEDGE MODELING: [entity type] - [relationships] - [temporal context]`
- `GRAPH ANALYTICS: [analysis type] - [patterns discovered] - [insights]`
- `NEO4J OPTIMIZATION: [query/config] - [performance improvement] - [metrics]`
- `SCHEMA DESIGN: [entities/relationships] - [design choice] - [scalability impact]`

**Use Cases:**
- Recording graph optimizations during development work
- Forcing Graphiti tracking without switching modes
- Manual logging of knowledge modeling decisions
- Documenting graph analytics discoveries in any context
