# /track-insight - Universal Insight Tracking

Capture significant insights, discoveries, or breakthroughs regardless of context.

## Usage
```
/track-insight "key discovery or insight"
/track-insight "cross-domain connection or pattern"
/track-insight "methodological breakthrough"
```

## Examples
```
/track-insight "Slash commands provide better context segmentation than file-based configuration"
/track-insight "Temporal knowledge graphs enable historical Islamic scholarship analysis"
/track-insight "Multi-instance coordination requires shared knowledge graph persistence"
```

## Implementation
This command captures insights that transcend specific domains:

**Direct Knowledge Graph Storage:**
- `UNIVERSAL INSIGHT: [domain] - [discovery/explanation] - [cross-domain impact]`
- `PATTERN DISCOVERY: [pattern type] - [where observed] - [broader implications]`
- `METHODOLOGY BREAKTHROUGH: [approach] - [innovation] - [applicability]`
- `CROSS-DOMAIN CONNECTION: [domain1] + [domain2] - [connection] - [synthesis]`
- `RESEARCH PARADIGM: [old approach] â†’ [new approach] - [advantages]`

**Use Cases:**
- Recording insights that span multiple contexts
- Capturing methodological innovations
- Documenting cross-domain pattern recognition
- Storing breakthrough moments for future reference

**Universal Application:**
- Works in any mode (dev, Islamic, Graphiti)
- Ideal for meta-insights about the project itself
- Perfect for recording paradigm shifts or major discoveries
