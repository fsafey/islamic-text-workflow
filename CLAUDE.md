# CLAUDE.md - Islamic Text Workflow Project

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the Islamic Text Workflow project - a comprehensive AI-powered platform for Islamic text research with Graphiti temporal knowledge graphs and multiple Claude Docker instances.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Islamic Text Workflow is a production-ready research platform that combines:
- **Temporal Knowledge Graphs** (Graphiti framework - 120,854+ lines)
- **Local Claude Docker Processing** (zero external API costs)
- **Islamic Text Analysis Specialization** (Arabic NLP, hadith, Quranic analysis)
- **Multiple Claude Instances** for parallel processing and research coordination
- **Academic Research Workflows** with persistent project intelligence

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

# Search knowledge graph
gs "search query for concepts or decisions" 

# Analyze text files
gt "/path/to/document.txt"

# Check system status
gst  # Shows Neo4j and Claude Docker API status
```

### Slash Commands (Available in Claude Code)

## üîß Development Workflow Integration

### Session Management
When starting work:
1. **Begin tracking**: `pstart "descriptive-session-name"`
2. **Work normally** - all commands available (gr, gs, gt, etc.)
3. **Track key activities** - use pdecision, pfeature, pproblem as needed
4. **End with summary**: `pend "summary of accomplishments"`

### Knowledge Persistence
- **Automatic Storage** - All tracked activities stored in Neo4j
- **Cross-Session Access** - Search previous work with psearch
- **Project Intelligence** - poverview shows recent activities and decisions
- **Export Capabilities** - Knowledge graphs exportable to research/output/

### Multiple Instance Coordination
- **Main Claude Code** - Primary development and conversation
- **Claude Docker (claude2)** - Specialized processing and experimentation
- **Graphiti Workers** - Background knowledge graph processing
- **Islamic NLP Mode** - Specialized Arabic text analysis

## üîç Search and Discovery Patterns

### Finding Previous Work
```bash
# Search for specific topics
psearch "authentication"
psearch "Islamic methodology" 
psearch "Docker configuration"

# Search knowledge graph
gs "concept relationships"
gs "hadith authentication methods"
gs "project architecture decisions"
```

### Project Intelligence Queries
```bash
# Recent activity overview
poverview

# Check current system status
gst

# Find related Islamic texts
gt "path/to/new_manuscript.txt"  # Analyzes and connects to existing knowledge
```

## üöÄ Advanced Usage Patterns

### Research Workflows
1. **Text Ingestion**: Use gt command for new Islamic texts
2. **Knowledge Building**: Insights automatically stored in graph
3. **Cross-Reference Discovery**: Search finds related concepts across texts
4. **Academic Output**: Export findings to research/output/ directory

### Development Workflows  
1. **Feature Development**: Track with pfeature command
2. **Decision Documentation**: Use pdecision for architectural choices
3. **Problem Resolution**: Log with pproblem command
4. **Code Documentation**: Track changes with pcode command

### Parallel Processing
1. **Main Session**: Continue normal Claude Code work
2. **Second Instance**: Launch `claude2` for specialized tasks
3. **Background Processing**: Long-running analysis in separate containers
4. **Coordination**: Knowledge graph maintains consistency across instances

- **`/dev-mode`** - Switch to general development tracking mode

### Usage Patterns
```bash
# Start a new development session
/pstart "graphiti-api-optimization"

# Switch to specialized mode
/graphiti-mode

# Store insights as you work
/gr "OPTIMIZATION: Query performance improved 40% with indexed relationships"

# Search for previous work
/gs "performance optimization"

# Analyze documentation
/gt "docs/architecture.md"

# Check system health
/gst

# Get project overview
/poverview
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start each session with `/poverview`** - See recent project activity and decisions
2. **Use slash commands for quick operations** - More efficient than bash commands
3. **Leverage `/claude2`** - Launch specialized instances for parallel processing
4. **Search before implementing** - Use `/psearch` to find previous solutions
5. **Trust the automation** - Knowledge graph captures insights as you work
6. **Review with `/gs`** - Search accumulated knowledge across all contexts

This project integrates **Graphiti v0.17.4** with **Claude Code slash commands** for intelligent, persistent, and collaborative development with context-aware automatic knowledge capture.
