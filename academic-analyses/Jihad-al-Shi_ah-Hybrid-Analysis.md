**Central Node**: The distinctive understanding and practice of jihad within Shia Islamic tradition and theology.

**Primary Connected Concepts**:
- **Genre Classification**: Theological-military treatise and historical analysis
- **Methodological Foundation**: Jurisprudential analysis combined with historical documentation and contemporary application
- **Scholarly Perspective**: Shia jurisprudential tradition with emphasis on defensive jihad and resistance against oppression
- **Core Argumentative Thesis**: Shia understanding of jihad as fundamentally defensive and tied to legitimate religious authority

**Secondary/Supporting Concepts**:
- The role of the Imam in authorizing legitimate jihad
- The concept of greater jihad (*jihad al-akbar*) versus lesser jihad (*jihad al-asghar*)
- Historical examples of Shia resistance and defensive warfare
- The relationship between social justice and legitimate struggle
- Gender perspectives on jihad and resistance in Shia thought

**Network Description**: This work represents a **theological-military treatise and historical analysis** whose **methodological foundation** of jurisprudential analysis combined with historical documentation and contemporary application creates a comprehensive framework for understanding Shia approaches to legitimate struggle. The **core argumentative thesis**—Shia understanding of jihad as fundamentally defensive and tied to legitimate religious authority—is executed through **Shia jurisprudential tradition** that emphasizes defensive jihad and resistance against oppression. This distinctive approach transforms military doctrine into spiritual and social justice theory, making the work both an academic study of Islamic military thought and a practical guide for understanding legitimate resistance in Shia theology.
