## Research Notes

Conducted comprehensive research on "Nizam Al-Usra Fi Al-Ahwal Al-Shakhsiyyah" (Family System in Personal Status Law). This title refers to the Islamic legal framework governing family relations and personal status matters within Islamic jurisprudence. The research revealed this as a systematic examination of Islamic family law (Al-Ahwal Al-Shakhsiyyah), which encompasses marriage, divorce, inheritance, child custody, and other domestic relations as codified in Islamic legal tradition. Modern implementations include recent reforms in countries like Saudi Arabia under Vision 2030, demonstrating the contemporary relevance of these classical legal principles.
