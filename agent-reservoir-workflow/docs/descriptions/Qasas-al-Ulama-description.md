The collection follows the established pattern of "Qasas" literature, similar to the renowned "Qasas al-Anbiya" (Stories of the Prophets), but focuses specifically on the lives and teachings of Islamic scholars ('Ulama). This biographical tradition developed as a crucial method for preserving Islamic intellectual heritage and maintaining the continuity of religious knowledge across generations.
