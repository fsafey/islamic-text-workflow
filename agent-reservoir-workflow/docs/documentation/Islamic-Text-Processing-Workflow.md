### **Input Requirements**
- **UUID**: Book identifier
- **Title**: Original book title (may contain transliteration issues)
- **Author**: Author name (retrieved via author_id join)

### **Process**
Use the **Hybrid Academic Analysis Prompt** (located in `Academic-Analysis-Prompt-V4-Hybrid.md`)

### **Output**
- **File**: `./islamic-text-workflow/academic-analyses/[Key-Title-Words]-Hybrid-Analysis.md`
- **Contains**: 
  - Research methodology documentation
  - Conceptual Network (Central Node, Primary/Secondary Concepts)
  - Structural Flowchart (detailed chapter-by-chapter breakdown)
  - Scholarly context and significance

---

## STAGE 2: Database Enrichment & Update

### **Purpose**
Generate and execute SQL UPDATE statements to enrich book database with searchable aliases, keywords, and academic description.

### **Input**
- Book UUID, Title, Author (via author_id join)
- Academic description from Stage 3 (or generated inline)
- Context from Stage 1 analysis (optional but recommended)

### **Process**
**MANDATORY STEP 1**: Read and study `./islamic-text-workflow/documentation/ENRICHMENT_CRITERIA.md` to understand:
- Transliteration variation requirements (Al-, el-, omitted articles)
- Special character simplification rules (_, _a, etc.)
- Vowel/consonant ambiguity handling (q/k, th/s, dh/d)
- Comprehensive keyword methodology (core concepts, associated figures, broader subjects)
- Quality examples demonstrating expected depth and breadth

**MANDATORY STEP 2**: Apply the Database Enrichment Prompt below using the ENRICHMENT_CRITERIA.md methodology

### **Database Enrichment Prompt**

**CRITICAL**: This prompt MUST be used in conjunction with the methodology detailed in `./islamic-text-workflow/documentation/ENRICHMENT_CRITERIA.md`. The criteria document provides the specific reasoning and examples for creating comprehensive title_alias and keywords that anticipate various user search patterns.

```markdown
You are an expert data enrichment agent specializing in Islamic texts and search optimization. Your task is to generate a single, perfectly formatted SQL UPDATE statement to enrich our book database.

INPUT DATA:
You will receive a book's UUID, Title, and Author (retrieved via author_id join).

INSTRUCTIONS:
Part 1: Generate Content
Based on the input data and your domain knowledge, generate the content for title_alias and keywords following the methodology in `ENRICHMENT_CRITERIA.md` and these rules:

For title_alias (a single string):
- Transliterations: Include common variations (Al-Ghadir, El-Ghadir, Alghadir).
- Simplify Special Characters: Convert al-Tara_ef to al-Taraef and al-Taraif. Convert _Aqaid to Aqaid and Aqaed.
- Phonetics: Account for common phonetic swaps (q/k, dh/d, th/s).
- Partial Titles: Extract the most memorable parts of long titles.
- Conceptual Titles: If applicable, create a simple English title describing the book's core topic (e.g., "The Verse of Cursing" for Ayat al-Mubahala).

For keywords (a list of strings):
- Core Concepts: Extract key ideas and figures directly from the title.
- Contextual Elements: Add related people (Imam Ali), places (Karbala), events (Event of Ghadir), and groups (Ahl al-Bayt).
- Author: Always include the author's name.
- Academic Fields: Add relevant subjects (Theology, Kalam, Hadith studies, History, Fiqh, Shia-Sunni relations).
- Synonyms: Add English and arabic synonyms (Guardianship for Wilayah) and simple transliterations of key terms.
- Include both english and arabic terms in output

Part 2: Format the Output
The final output must be only the SQL code and nothing else, following this strict format:
- Structure: UPDATE books SET ... WHERE id = ...;
- title_alias: Format as a single string, with aliases separated by a semicolon and a space (;).
- keywords: Format as a PostgreSQL string array literal. Each keyword must be in double quotes ("), separated by a comma, and the whole list enclosed in curly braces and single quotes (e.g., '{"Keyword1", "Keyword2"}').
- WHERE Clause: Use the provided UUID for the id.

EXAMPLE (Following ENRICHMENT_CRITERIA.md methodology):
Input:
UUID: ff80f37f-56e9-427b-8ace-8f6a03c4cef9
Title: Al-Ghadir fi al-Kitab wa al-Sunnah wa al-Adab
Author: Abbas Mohsen Ahmad al-Amini al-Najafi

Required Output:
UPDATE books SET
  title_alias = 'Al-Ghadir in the Book, Sunnah, and Literature; Al-Ghadir; Ghadir Khumm; Ghadir in the Quran and Hadith; Al Ghadir; El-Ghadir; Alghadir',
  keywords = '{"Ghadir Khumm", "Event of Ghadir", "Hadith of Ghadir", "Imam Ali", "Wilayah", "Guardianship", "Succession to the Prophet", "Abbas Mohsen Ahmad al-Amini al-Najafi", "Al-Amini", "Shia-Sunni relations", "Hadith studies", "History"}'
WHERE id = 'ff80f37f-56e9-427b-8ace-8f6a03c4cef9';
```

## STAGE 3: Academic Description Generation (INTEGRATED)

### **Purpose**
Create polished, publication-ready academic descriptions from the structured analysis data.

### **Process**
**MANDATORY STEP 1**: Extract structured data from Stage 1 hybrid analysis:
- Locate the **Central Node** from Part 1: Conceptual Network
- Identify the **Primary Connected Concepts** (all 4 elements: Genre, Methodology, Perspective, Thesis)
- Extract **Secondary/Supporting Concepts** from the secondary concepts list
- Find **Key Evidence/Terms** from Part 2: Structural Flowchart (specific verses, events, figures, Arabic terms)
- Determine **Author's Core Project** from the Network Description and Scholarly Context sections

**MANDATORY STEP 2**: Apply the Description Generation Prompt below with the extracted data

**MANDATORY STEP 3**: Verify the output follows the 5-step narrative structure and meets quality standards

### **Input Requirements**
Structured data extracted from Stage 1 analysis:
- **Central Node**: [Single most important thesis from conceptual network]
- **Primary Connected Concepts**: [Genre + Methodology + Perspective + Thesis from Part 1]
- **Secondary/Supporting Concepts**: [Supporting ideas from conceptual network]
- **Key Evidence/Terms**: [Specific citations, verses, events, Arabic terms from structural flowchart]
- **Author's Core Project**: [Ultimate goal from network description and scholarly context]

### **Description Generation Prompt**
```markdown
You are an expert academic content writer. Your task is to synthesize the provided structured data points about a book into a single, concise, and informative description of approximately 100-150 words.

INPUT DATA:
- Title: [Book Title]
- Author: [Author Name]
- Central Node: [Primary thesis/argument]
- Primary Concepts: [Main supporting pillars]
- Key Evidence/Terms: [Specific citations, concepts, Arabic terms]
- Author's Core Project: [Ultimate goal/contribution]

INSTRUCTIONS:
You must construct the description by following this exact 5-step narrative structure:

1. **Initial Sentence (Identity)**: Start by introducing the book, clearly stating that the author analyzes the source text.

2. **State the Thesis (The "Nizam")**: Immediately follow with the book's central argument, using the 'Author's Core Project' and 'Central Node'. Emphasize systematic approach.

3. **Explain the Pillars (The "How")**: In the next one or two sentences, explain what this system is built on. Weave in the 'Primary Concepts' provided. You must include key Arabic terms in italics.

4. **Ground in Evidence (The "Proof")**: Make the argument concrete by mentioning the most significant 'Key Evidence'. Briefly mention another concept to demonstrate scope.

5. **Concluding Thought (The "Why")**: End with a powerful concluding sentence that summarizes the author's ultimate goal, framing the work as relevant model.

CRITICAL: Do not simply list keywords. Your output must be a single, well-written paragraph that flows logically. Maintain an academic and encyclopedic tone.

EXAMPLE (Al-Ghadir fi al-Kitab wa al-Sunnah wa al-Adab):
INPUT DATA:
- Title: Al-Ghadir fi al-Kitab wa al-Sunnah wa al-Adab
- Author: Al-Amini
- Central Node: The Event of Ghadir Khumm
- Primary Concepts: Comprehensive encyclopedia, exhaustive source compilation, Shi'a Imami scholasticism, proof of Ali's Wilayah
- Key Evidence: Hadith al-Thaqalayn, 110 Companions, Verse of Proclamation (5:67), Hassan ibn Thabit's poetry
- Author's Core Project: Establishing Ali's explicit appointment through Sunni sources

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
In "Al-Ghadir fi al-Kitab wa al-Sunnah wa al-Adab," Al-Amini analyzes the Event of Ghadir Khumm through comprehensive source compilation. Al-Amini systematically argues that this event represents the explicit appointment of Imam Ali to *Wilayah* (Guardianship), demonstrating this through an encyclopedic methodology that exclusively employs Sunni-accepted sources. This thesis is built upon exhaustive documentation from three pillars: *Kitab* (Quranic sources), *Sunnah* (prophetic traditions), and *Adab* (Arabic poetry and literature). The work grounds its argument in critical analysis of *Hadith al-Thaqalayn* and testimonies from 110 Companions (*Sahaba*), while systematically examining the Verse of Proclamation (Al-Ma'idah 5:67) and its contextual revelation at Ghadir. Al-Amini's comprehensive approach transforms this work into a cornerstone of Shi'a apologetics, offering an irrefutable framework for establishing the legitimacy of Ali's succession through the very sources accepted by Sunni scholarship.
```

### **Quality Checkpoints**
Before proceeding to Stage 2, verify your description meets these standards:
- **Word Count**: Exactly 100-150 words
- **5-Step Structure**: Clear progression through Identity → Thesis → Pillars → Evidence → Conclusion
- **Academic Tone**: Scholarly, encyclopedic voice maintained throughout
- **Arabic Terms**: Key Islamic terms properly italicized (*Wilayah*, *Sunnah*, etc.)
- **Logical Flow**: Single paragraph that reads naturally without abrupt transitions
- **Specificity**: Concrete evidence and examples, not vague generalities

### **Output**
- **Integration**: Description included directly in Stage 2 SQL file
- **Alternative**: `./descriptions/[Key-Title-Words]-description.md` for separate reference
- **Contains**: 100-150 word academic description that meets all quality checkpoints

## Workflow Execution Guide

### **Step-by-Step Process**

1. **Initialize Folders** (if not already created)
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ./academic-analyses
   mkdir -p ./sql-updates
   mkdir -p ./descriptions
   mkdir -p ./workflows
   ```

2. **Execute Stage 1**
   - Use `Academic-Analysis-Prompt-V4-Hybrid.md` prompt
   - Input: UUID + Title + Author
   - Verify output saved to `./academic-analyses/`

3. **Execute Stage 2 & 3 (Integrated)**
   - **MANDATORY**: Read and apply `./islamic-text-workflow/documentation/ENRICHMENT_CRITERIA.md` methodology
   - Generate academic description using Description Generation Prompt
   - Use Database Enrichment Prompt with ENRICHMENT_CRITERIA.md methodology for comprehensive title_alias and keywords
   - Create individual SQL file: `./sql-updates/[Key-Title-Words]-enrichment.sql`
   - **Append to consolidated file**: Add SQL statement to `./sql-updates/batch-enrichment-updates.sql`
   - Execute individual SQL against Supabase database (for immediate testing)
   - Verify database update successful

4. **Batch Processing Management**
   - **Individual Processing**: Execute single book updates immediately for testing
   - **Batch Processing**: Accumulate multiple SQL statements in consolidated file
   - **Batch Execution**: Run consolidated file when ready to update multiple books
   - **Backup**: Always maintain individual SQL files for reference and rollback

5. **Optional: Separate Description File**
   - Save standalone description to `./descriptions/[Key-Title-Words]-description.md` if needed for other purposes

### **Quality Assurance Checkpoints**

## Consolidated SQL File Management

### **Adding New Books to Batch File**

When processing a new book, append the SQL update to the consolidated file using this template:

```sql
-- ======================================================================
-- BOOK [N]: [Book Title]
-- Author: [Author Name]
-- Processed: [Date]
-- Status: [PENDING/EXECUTED]
-- ======================================================================

UPDATE books SET
  title_alias = '[Generated aliases]',
  keywords = '[Generated keywords array]',
  description = '[Generated description]'
WHERE id = '[Book UUID]';
```

### **Batch File Maintenance**

1. **Status Tracking**: Update status comments from PENDING to EXECUTED after running
2. **Transaction Safety**: Keep BEGIN/COMMIT structure for bulk operations
3. **Backup Strategy**: Always test individual SQL files before adding to batch
4. **Version Control**: Consider creating dated copies of batch file for large updates

### **Example Batch Execution Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Process multiple books individually (testing each)
# 2. Accumulate SQL statements in batch file
# 3. Review consolidated file
# 4. Execute batch update
PGPASSWORD="sXm0id2x7pEjggUd" psql \
  -h aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com \
  -p 5432 \
  -U postgres.aayvvcpxafzhcjqewwja \
  -d postgres \
  -f ./sql-updates/batch-enrichment-updates.sql
# 5. Update status comments to EXECUTED
```
