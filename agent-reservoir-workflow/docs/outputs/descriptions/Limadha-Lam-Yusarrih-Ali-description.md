# Academic Description: Limadha Lam Yusarrih Bi-Ism al-Imam Ali (AS) fi al-Quran al-Karim

**Author**: Ayatollah al-Sayyid Mortada al-Husseini al-Shirazi

Ayatollah al-Shirazi analyzes one of the most challenging questions in Shi'a theology: why Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib's name does not appear explicitly in the Quran despite his paramount importance in Imami doctrine. The work argues that this apparent absence reflects Divine Wisdom (*Hikmah Ilahiyyah*) rather than neglect, presenting the implicit nature of Ali's designation as a sophisticated theological system. This system is built on three fundamental pillars: Divine Pedagogy in revelation, the doctrine of *Wilayah* (Guardianship), and Shi'a hermeneutical methodology (*Tafsir Shi'i*). Al-Shirazi grounds his argument in detailed analysis of key Quranic verses such as the *Mubahala* Verse (3:61) and the *Wilayah* Verse (5:55), demonstrating how contextual clues (*Qara'in*) and esoteric interpretation (*Ta'wil*) reveal Ali's implicit designation. The author concludes that this divine approach serves multiple purposes: protecting the early Muslim community from immediate division, establishing a test of spiritual discernment for believers, and creating a hermeneutical framework that requires divine guidance through *Ahl al-Bayt* for proper understanding, thus presenting a timeless model for sophisticated Shi'a apologetics in contemporary theological discourse.
