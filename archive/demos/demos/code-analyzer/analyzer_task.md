# Code Analyzer Demo Task

## Objective
Create an automated code analysis tool that:
1. Analyzes Python/JavaScript codebases
2. Extracts all functions, classes, and dependencies
3. Generates a complexity report
4. Creates a dependency graph

## Requirements
- Use Serena MCP for code indexing
- Calculate cyclomatic complexity
- Identify code smells
- Generate markdown report

## Analysis Features
- Function/class documentation coverage
- Import analysis
- Code duplication detection
- Suggested refactoring opportunities

## Expected Output
- `analysis_report.md` with findings
- `dependency_graph.json` for visualization
- Summary statistics
