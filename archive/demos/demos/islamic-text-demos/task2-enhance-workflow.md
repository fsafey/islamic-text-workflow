# Task 2: Enhance Text Processing Workflow

## Objective
Use Claude Docker with Context7 MCP to research latest NLP techniques and enhance the Islamic text processing pipeline.

## Instructions for Claude
"Based on the existing .mcp.json configuration and project structure, enhance the Islamic text processing workflow:

1. **Research Latest Tools**:
   - Use Context7 to get documentation for modern NLP libraries (spaCy, transformers, etc.)
   - Research Islamic text processing best practices
   - Find libraries specifically for Arabic/Islamic text analysis

2. **Enhance Pipeline**:
   - Improve the existing text processing methodology
   - Add sentiment analysis for Islamic texts
   - Implement named entity recognition for Islamic concepts
   - Add text summarization capabilities

3. **Create New Features**:
   - Automated cross-referencing between texts
   - Theme extraction and categorization
   - Citation and reference tracking
   - Multi-language support (Arabic/English)

## Expected Outputs
- Enhanced processing scripts with new capabilities
- `workflow_enhancements.md` documenting improvements
- Updated requirements and dependencies
- Sample analysis using new features

## Real-World Value
This shows how Claude Docker can research cutting-edge techniques and immediately implement them in your actual research workflow."
