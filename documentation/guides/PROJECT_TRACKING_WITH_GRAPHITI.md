# Project Tracking with Graphiti

## Overview

Graphiti is now fully configured to track your **Islamic Text Workflow project development sessions** and assist with project building. This is separate from the NLP text analysis workflows - this focuses on tracking your development work, decisions, and project evolution.

## ‚úÖ What's Configured

- **Development Session Tracking**: Automatic logging of work sessions
- **Decision Recording**: Track architectural and technical decisions
- **Feature Development**: Monitor feature progress and status
- **Problem/Solution Tracking**: Log issues encountered and resolutions
- **Code Change Documentation**: Track modifications to project files
- **Research Logging**: Record learning and investigation activities
- **Git Integration**: Automatic branch and commit status tracking
- **Knowledge Graph Storage**: All project data stored in Neo4j with Claude Docker

## üöÄ Project Tracking Commands

### Session Management

```bash
# Start a work session
pstart "feature-development"
project_session_start "integrating-new-mcp-server"

# End session with summary
pend "Successfully integrated Graphiti MCP server with Claude Docker"
project_session_end "Completed authentication refactoring"
```

### Decision Tracking

```bash
# Record technical decisions
pdecision "Using Claude Docker instead of OpenAI APIs for local processing"
project_decision "Switched from file-based coordination to MCP server architecture"
```

### Feature Development

```bash
# Track feature work
pfeature "Graphiti integration" "completed"
project_feature "Arabic text preprocessing pipeline" "in-progress"
```

### Problem Solving

```bash
# Log problems and solutions
pproblem "Neo4j port conflict" "Stopped conflicting container, used Docker Compose"
project_problem "Memory usage too high during text processing" "Implemented batch processing"
```

### Code Changes

```bash
# Document code modifications
pcode "tools/scripts/graphiti-commands.sh" "Added project-specific entity types"
project_code_change "infrastructure/configs/.mcp.json" "Updated Graphiti server configuration"
```

### Research & Learning

```bash
# Track research activities
presearch "MCP server architecture" "Learned about stdin/stdio transport vs SSE"
project_research "Islamic NLP libraries" "Found several Python packages for Arabic text processing"
```

### Project Intelligence

```bash
# Search project history
psearch "docker"
project_search "authentication"

# Get project overview
poverview
project_overview
```

## üß† Knowledge Graph Integration

All project tracking data is stored in your Neo4j knowledge graph with these entity types:

- **ProjectSession**: Work sessions with start/end times and summaries
- **ProjectDecision**: Technical and architectural decisions with rationale
- **ProjectFeature**: Features being developed with status tracking
- **ProjectProblem**: Issues encountered with solutions
- **CodeChange**: File modifications with descriptions
- **Research**: Learning activities and findings

## üìä Current Project State

```bash
poverview
```

Shows:
- Git branch and commit status
- Recent work sessions  
- Recent decisions made
- Key project directories
- Modified files count

## üîç Search & Discovery

```bash
# Find specific project activities
psearch "authentication"     # Find auth-related work
psearch "docker"            # Find Docker-related activities  
psearch "mcp"               # Find MCP server work
psearch "graphiti"          # Find Graphiti integration work
```

## üìÅ File Storage

- **Knowledge Graph**: Primary storage in Neo4j (`bolt://localhost:7687`)
- **Local Memory**: Backup in `~/.claude/project_memory.txt`
- **Session Logs**: Timestamped entries for all activities

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

### Starting Your Day

```bash
# Begin tracking your work
pstart "daily-development-$(date +%m-%d)"

# Check what was done recently
poverview
```

### During Development

```bash
# As you work, track key activities:
pdecision "Decided to use Pydantic models for MCP entity validation"
pcode "mcp_server/graphiti_mcp_server.py" "Added ProjectSession entity type"
pfeature "Session tracking" "completed"
```

### End of Session

```bash
# Wrap up with summary
pend "Completed Graphiti project tracking integration with full session management"
```

## üéØ Benefits for Your Islamic Text Workflow Project

1. **Development History**: Complete record of how your project evolved
2. **Decision Tracking**: Why you made specific technical choices
3. **Problem Solutions**: Reusable solutions for common issues
4. **Feature Progress**: Clear visibility into what's been built
5. **Learning Log**: Research and discoveries during development
6. **Team Communication**: Shareable project insights and decisions
7. **Documentation Aid**: Automatic generation of project history

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Auto-tracking Git Commits

```bash
# After making a commit, track it:
git commit -m "Add Graphiti MCP integration"
project_auto_commit_hook "Add Graphiti MCP integration"
```

### Research Sessions

```bash
pstart "research-arabic-nlp"
presearch "Arabic stemming algorithms" "Investigated ISRI and Khoja stemmers"
presearch "Islamic text corpora" "Found OpenITI and Shamela digital libraries"
pend "Identified key NLP tools and datasets for Islamic text processing"
```

### Feature Development Cycles

```bash
pstart "feature-text-analysis"
pfeature "Hadith authenticity checker" "planned"
pcode "analyzers/hadith.py" "Created initial hadith analysis module"
pproblem "Chain validation logic" "Need to implement sanad verification"
pfeature "Hadith authenticity checker" "in-progress"
pend "Made progress on hadith analyzer, sanad validation pending"
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Enable tracking** in your current session:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc  # Loads all commands
   ```

2. **Start your first session**:
   ```bash
   pstart "graphiti-familiarization"
   ```

3. **Record this integration work**:
   ```bash
   pdecision "Integrated Graphiti for project development tracking"
   pfeature "Development session tracking" "completed"
   ```

4. **End with summary**:
   ```bash
   pend "Successfully set up comprehensive project tracking with Graphiti knowledge graphs"
   ```

Your Islamic Text Workflow project now has intelligent development tracking! üß†‚ú®
