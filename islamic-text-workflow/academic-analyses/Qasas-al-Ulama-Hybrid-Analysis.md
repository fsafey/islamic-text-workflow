## Research Notes

Conducted comprehensive research on the genre of Islamic biographical literature, specifically focusing on *Qasas al-Ulama* (Stories of the Scholars) and the broader tradition of *Tabaqat* (biographical dictionaries) in Islamic scholarship. The research revealed that this genre serves both as historical documentation and spiritual guidance, preserving the intellectual and moral heritage of Islamic scholarship while providing exemplary models for contemporary scholars and students. The work falls within the established tradition of *'Ilm al-Rijal* (Science of Narrators) and biographical evaluation, which developed in the second century AH and reached its golden age under the Mamluks (c.1250-1500 CE).
