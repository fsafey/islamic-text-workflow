-- MIGRATION: Deploy Streamlined 25-Field Schema
-- Purpose: Create streamlined tables alongside existing ones for testing

-- First, run the streamlined schema creation

-- VALIDATION QUERIES
-- =============================================

-- Check migration results
SELECT 'Analysis Results Migration' as table_name,

-- Check streamlined pipeline status
SELECT 
    overall_status,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM streamlined_pipeline_status 
GROUP BY overall_status
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- =============================================
-- UPDATE MAKE.COM WEBHOOK ENDPOINTS
-- =============================================

-- The Make.com scenario final_make_scenario.json has been updated to use:
-- - book_analysis_results_streamlined (8 essential fields)
-- - book_enrichment_results_streamlined (17 essential fields)

-- Test the new endpoints with this sample data:
/*
-- Test Analysis Endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/claude/hybrid-analysis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "book_id": "test-uuid-123",
    "title": "Test Islamic Book", 
    "author": "Test Author"
  }'

-- Test Enrichment Endpoint  
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/claude/enrichment-execution \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "book_id": "test-uuid-123",
    "analysis_data": {
      "central_node": "Test analysis",
      "genre_classification": "Islamic scholarship"
    },
    "original_book": {
      "title": "Test Islamic Book",
      "author_name": "Test Author"
    }
  }'
*/

-- =============================================
-- CLEANUP (OPTIONAL - FOR PRODUCTION CUTOVER)
-- =============================================

-- After testing and validation, optionally rename tables for production cutover:
/*
-- Backup original tables
ALTER TABLE book_analysis_results RENAME TO book_analysis_results_backup_155_fields;
ALTER TABLE book_enrichment_results RENAME TO book_enrichment_results_backup_155_fields;

-- Promote streamlined tables to production names
ALTER TABLE book_analysis_results_streamlined RENAME TO book_analysis_results;
ALTER TABLE book_enrichment_results_streamlined RENAME TO book_enrichment_results;

-- Update any remaining references in views, functions, etc.
*/
