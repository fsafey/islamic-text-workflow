Written by the 13th-century Damascus scholar Ibn Taymiyyah during the Mongol invasions, this work addresses fundamental questions about the relationship between faith and deeds, the concept of hypocrisy, and how faith can increase or decrease based on a believer's actions. The book draws heavily from the Qur'an, hadith, and the understanding of the Salaf (early Muslim generations). It serves as both a theological treatise and practical guide, addressing sectarian debates while maintaining scholarly rigor and accessibility for serious students of Islamic theology.\",\n  \"themes\": [\n    \"Nature and definition of faith (Iman)\",\n    \"Relationship between faith and good deeds\",\n    \"Refutation of deviant sects (Murji'ah, Jahmiyyah, Karramiyyah)\",\n    \"Scriptural foundations from Quran and Hadith\",\n    \"Practical application of faith in daily life\",\n    \"Theological debates on belief and action\",\n    \"Concept of faith increasing and decreasing\"\n  ],\n  \"historical_context\": \"Written during the late 13th/early 14th century amid the Mongol invasions of Damascus and the destruction of the Abbasid caliphate. Ibn Taymiyyah lived through multiple crises including the Mongol invasions (1299-1303), the rise of the Mamluk dynasty, and constant threats to Islamic civilization. This turbulent period shaped his urgent need to clarify authentic Islamic doctrine and combat theological deviations that threatened the Muslim community's unity and faith.\",\n  \"significance\": \"One of the most influential works in Islamic theology, providing authoritative clarification on the nature of faith that has shaped Sunni Islamic thought for centuries. The book's methodological approach of returning to primary sources (Quran and Sunnah) and its systematic refutation of sectarian positions established it as a foundational text for Islamic scholars. Its influence extends to modern Islamic reform movements and continues to be studied as an advanced theological work requiring solid foundation in Islamic sciences.\"\n}\n```",
