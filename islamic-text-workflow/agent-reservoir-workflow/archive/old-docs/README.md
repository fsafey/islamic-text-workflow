These files were replaced by `SIMPLE-SETUP-GUIDE.md` for easier use.

## Archived Files:
- `DIRECT-SHEETS-SUPABASE-GUIDE.md` - Technical implementation details
- `GOOGLE-APPS-SCRIPT-SETUP.md` - Comprehensive script guide with advanced features  
- `GOOGLE-SHEETS-STAGING-GUIDE.md` - Database staging system explanation

## Current Active File:
**Use this instead**: `/SIMPLE-SETUP-GUIDE.md`

## Why Archived:
- Too technical and confusing
- Multiple overlapping guides
- Database setup was already complete
- User needed simple step-by-step process

These files contain valuable technical details for future reference but are not needed for basic setup.
