              "content": "### 4. SSH Keys for Git Push (Optional - for push/pull operations)\nClaude Docker uses dedicated SSH keys (separate from your main SSH keys for security):\n\n**Setup SSH keys:**\n```bash\n# 1. Create directory for Claude Docker SSH keys\nmkdir -p ~/.claude-docker/ssh\n\n# 2. Generate SSH key for Claude Docker\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.claude-docker/ssh/id_rsa -N ''\n\n# 3. Add public key to GitHub\ncat ~/.claude-docker/ssh/id_rsa.pub\n# Copy output and add to: GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key\n\n# 4. Test connection\nssh -T git@github.com -i ~/.claude-docker/ssh/id_rsa\n```\n\n**Why separate SSH keys?**\n- ✅ **Security Isolation**: Claude can't access or modify your personal SSH keys, config, or known_hosts\n- ✅ **SSH State Persistence**: The SSH directory is mounted at runtime.\n- ✅ **Easy Revocation**: Delete `~/.claude-docker/ssh/` to instantly revoke Claude's git access\n- ✅ **Clean Audit Trail**: All Claude SSH activity is isolated and easily traceable\n\n**Technical Note**: We mount the SSH directory rather than copying keys because SSH operations modify several files (`known_hosts`, connection state) that must persist between container sessions for a smooth user experience.\n\n### 5. Twilio Account (Optional - for SMS notifications)\nIf you want SMS notifications when tasks complete:\n- Create free trial account: https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account\n- Get your Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Console\n- Get a phone number for sending SMS\n\n### Why Pre-authentication?\nThe Docker container needs your existing Claude authentication to function. This approach:\n- ✅ Uses your existing Claude subscription/API access\n- ✅ Maintains secure credential handling\n- ✅ Enables persistent authentication across container restarts\n\n\n### Environment Variables (.env)\n```bash\n# SMS notifications (highly recommended!)\n# Perfect for long-running tasks - step away and get notified when done\nTWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid  \nTWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token\nTWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+1234567890\nTWILIO_TO_NUMBER=+0987654321\n\n# Optional - Custom conda paths\nCONDA_PREFIX=/path/to/your/conda\nCONDA_EXTRA_DIRS=\"/path/to/envs /path/to/pkgs\"\n\n# Optional - System packages\nSYSTEM_PACKAGES=\"libopenslide0 libgdal-dev\"\n```\n\n⚠️ **Security Note**: Credentials are baked into the Docker image. Keep your image secure!\n\n## Features\n\n### 🤖 Full Autonomy\n- Claude runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for complete access\n- Can read, write, execute, and modify any files in your project\n- No permission prompts or restrictions\n\n### 🔌 Modular MCP Server Support\n- Easy installation of any MCP server through `mcp-servers.txt`\n- Automatic environment variable handling for MCP servers requiring API keys\n- Pre-configured popular servers (Twilio, GitHub, filesystem, browser automation)\n- See [MCP_SERVERS.md](MCP_SERVERS.md) for full setup guide\n\n### 📱 SMS Notifications  \n- Automatic SMS via Twilio when Claude completes tasks\n- Configurable via MCP integration\n- Optional - works without if Twilio not configured\n\n### 🐍 Conda Integration\n- Has access to your conda envs so do not need to add build instructions to the Dockerfile\n- Supports custom conda installation directories (ideal for academic/lab environments where home is quota'd)\n\n\n### 🔑 Persistence\n- Login once, use forever - authentication tokens persist across sessions\n- Automatic UID/GID mapping ensures perfect file permissions between host and container\n- Loads history from previous chats in a given project.\n\n### �� Task Execution Logging  \n- Prompt engineered to generate `task_log.md` documenting agent's execution process\n- Stores assumptions, insights, and challenges encountered\n- Acts as a simple summary to quickly understand what the agent accomplished\n\n### 🐳 Clean Environment\n- Each session runs in fresh Docker container\n- Only current working directory mounted (along with conda directories specified in `.env`).\n\n\n## Configuration\nDuring build, the `.env` file from the claude-docker repository directory is baked into the image:\n- Credentials are embedded at `/app/.env` inside the container\n- No need to manage .env files in each project\n- The image contains everything needed to run\n- **Important**: After updating `.env`, you must rebuild the image with `claude-docker --rebuild`\n\nThe setup creates `~/.claude-docker/` in your home directory with:\n- `claude-home/` - Persistent Claude authentication and settings\n- `ssh/` - Directory where claude-dockers private ssh key and known hosts file is stored.\n\n### Template Configuration Copy\nDuring installation (`install.sh`), all contents from the project's `.claude/` directory are copied to `~/.claude-docker/claude-home/` as template/base settings. This includes:\n- `settings.json` - Default Claude Code settings with MCP configuration\n- `CLAUDE.md` - Default instructions and protocols  \n- `commands/` - Slash commands (if any)\n- Any other configuration files\n\n**To modify these settings:**\n- **Recommended**: Directly edit files in `~/.claude-docker/claude-home/`\n- **Alternative**: Modify `.claude/` in this repository and re-run `install.sh`\n\nAll changes to `~/.claude-docker/claude-home/` persist across container sessions.\n\nEach project gets:\n- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code settings with MCP\n- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific instructions (if you create one)"
