  description = 'In "Al-Istinsakh Jadl Al-''Asr," Al-Shaykh Ja''far Hasan ''Atrisi analyzes the contemporary scholarly controversy surrounding the concept of *naskh* (abrogation) in Quranic interpretation and Islamic law. ''Atrisi systematically argues that contemporary debates about *naskh* can be resolved through careful examination of classical methodology versus modern objections, demonstrating this through comparative analysis of traditional Islamic legal theory and contemporary textual criticism. This thesis is built upon three methodological pillars: linguistic analysis of *naskh* evolution from copying (*istinsakh*) to nullification, examination of classical abrogation categories and their modern challenges, and systematic refutation of 19th-century modernist objections to traditional theory. The work grounds its argument in detailed analysis of classical authorities like Al-Shafi''i''s *al-Risala* and addresses contemporary misuse of abrogation by extremist groups, while systematically examining the relationship between *naskh al-hukm dun al-tilawa* and *naskh al-tilawa dun al-hukm* in modern jurisprudential applications. ''Atrisi''s traditional approach transforms classical *''ulum al-Qur''an* into contemporary apologetic framework, offering a crucial defense of orthodox interpretative methods against modernist challenges while addressing legitimate concerns about scholarly integrity and interfaith dialogue.'
