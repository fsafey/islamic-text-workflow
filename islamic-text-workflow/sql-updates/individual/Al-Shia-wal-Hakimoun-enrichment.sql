  description = 'A comprehensive political-historical analysis examining the complex relationship between Shia Muslims and political authority throughout Islamic history. This important work by prominent Lebanese scholar Muhammad Jawad Mughniyah provides a systematic examination of how Shia communities have experienced political power, persecution, and survival strategies under various ruling systems from early Islamic history to the modern era. The book combines historical analysis with contemporary political critique, exploring themes of political legitimacy, justice, and resistance in Islamic thought. Through detailed examination of events from the succession crisis after Prophet Muhammad to modern Islamic governance models, the work demonstrates how Shia political experience offers valuable insights into broader questions of Islamic political theory and practice. The author critiques Western democratic systems while advocating for Islamic governance models, emphasizing the importance of justice and unity in Islamic political thought. This scholarly work serves as both a historical study of Shia political experience and a theoretical contribution to understanding Islamic political legitimacy and governance in the contemporary world.'
