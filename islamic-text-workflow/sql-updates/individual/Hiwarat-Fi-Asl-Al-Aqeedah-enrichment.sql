    description = 'An innovative Islamic theological treatise employing dialogue methodology to teach fundamental Islamic creedal principles through interactive question-answer format. The work systematically covers the three pillars of Islamic belief - divine unity (tawḥīd), prophetic mission (risāla), and afterlife (maʿād) - through structured conversations between teacher, student, and skeptic participants. Drawing from both rational proofs and scriptural evidence, the author presents cosmological, teleological, and ontological arguments for divine existence while addressing contemporary challenges including atheist objections, Christian Trinity doctrine, and scientific materialism. The pedagogical approach transforms traditional theological exposition into dynamic intellectual engagement, making complex creedal concepts accessible through dialogue format. Particularly valuable for Islamic educational institutions seeking innovative teaching methods that combine classical kalām methodology with modern educational theory. The work represents a synthesis of traditional Islamic scholarship with contemporary learning approaches, demonstrating how fundamental Islamic beliefs can be effectively understood and defended through structured rational inquiry within traditional frameworks.'
