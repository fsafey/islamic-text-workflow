  description = 'Ayatollah al-Shirazi analyzes one of the most challenging questions in Shia theology: why Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib''s name does not appear explicitly in the Quran despite his paramount importance in Imami doctrine. The work argues that this apparent absence reflects Divine Wisdom (Hikmah Ilahiyyah) rather than neglect, presenting the implicit nature of Ali''s designation as a sophisticated theological system. This system is built on three fundamental pillars: Divine Pedagogy in revelation, the doctrine of Wilayah (Guardianship), and Shia hermeneutical methodology (Tafsir Shii). Al-Shirazi grounds his argument in detailed analysis of key Quranic verses such as the Mubahala Verse (3:61) and the Wilayah Verse (5:55), demonstrating how contextual clues (Qarain) and esoteric interpretation (Tawil) reveal Ali''s implicit designation. The author concludes that this divine approach serves multiple purposes: protecting the early Muslim community from immediate division, establishing a test of spiritual discernment for believers, and creating a hermeneutical framework that requires divine guidance through Ahl al-Bayt for proper understanding, thus presenting a timeless model for sophisticated Shia apologetics in contemporary theological discourse.'
