  description = 'In "Muhammad Khatam Al-Nabiyyin," Dr. Ali Shari''ati analyzes the theological and socio-political implications of Prophet Muhammad''s status as the final prophet. Shari''ati systematically argues that Muhammad''s finality as *Khatam al-Nabiyyin* carries profound implications for Islamic society''s structure, governance, and revolutionary potential, demonstrating this through integration of traditional Islamic sources with modern sociological theory. This thesis is built upon three methodological pillars: Quranic exegesis of prophetic finality, analysis of *Hadith al-Thaqalayn* and succession traditions, and comparative religious studies examining prophetic finality across Abrahamic traditions. The work grounds its argument in detailed analysis of Quran 33:40 and its implications for *Wilayah* (Guardianship), while systematically examining how the end of prophecy opens space for human reasoning and social development through *Ijtihad*. Shari''ati''s revolutionary approach transforms traditional theological discussion into a dynamic framework for understanding Islam''s transformative potential, offering a cornerstone analysis for contemporary Islamic revival movements seeking to bridge classical theology with modern social liberation.'
