  description = 'In "Shajarat Tuba," al-Alamah al-Haeri analyzes the systematic presentation of foundational Islamic knowledge through the metaphorical framework of the blessed tree of Paradise (Tuba). Al-Haeri systematically argues that Islamic knowledge forms an organic, interconnected system comparable to the Quranic tree Tuba, with each branch representing essential aspects of faith and practice, demonstrating this through integration of Islamic jurisprudence (*Fiqh*), theological doctrine (*Aqidah*), and spiritual development (*Tasawwuf*). This thesis is built upon three methodological pillars: foundational principles examining divine unity (*Tawhid*) and jurisprudential methodology (*Usul al-Fiqh*), core sciences integrating Quranic interpretation and hadith studies, and applied sciences connecting ritual obligations with spiritual purification (*Tazkiyah*). The work grounds its argument in systematic analysis of seminary (*Hawzah*) educational methodology and the Haeri scholarly tradition, while demonstrating the integration of legal reasoning (*Ijtihad*) with spiritual development. Al-Haeri''s metaphorical approach transforms this work into a comprehensive educational philosophy, offering a holistic framework that bridges intellectual rigor with spiritual realization for contemporary Islamic scholarship and seminary education.'
