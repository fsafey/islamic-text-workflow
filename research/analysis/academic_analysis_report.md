## Hybrid Analysis Methodology

### Two-Part Analytical Framework

#### Part 1: Conceptual Network Analysis
**Central Node Structure:**
- Core thematic/theological focus identification
- Primary concept mapping across 4 categories:
  1. **Genre Classification** - Text type and literary form
  2. **Methodological Foundation** - Analytical approach and scholarly method
  3. **Scholarly Perspective** - Theological and sectarian positioning
  4. **Core Argumentative Thesis** - Primary claims and conclusions

**Network Synthesis:**
- Secondary/supporting concept identification
- Interconnection mapping between concepts
- Narrative synthesis connecting all analytical components

#### Part 2: Structural Flowchart Analysis
- Systematic breakdown of text organization
- Sequential mapping of content sections
- Argumentative flow documentation
- Internal logical structure navigation
- Methodological framework consistency tracking
