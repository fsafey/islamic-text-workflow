# 2025-07-16_052855 - Context-Aware Slash Commands Implementation

**Session Type**: Development Configuration  
**Key Participants**: User, Claude2 (Interactive Shell Mode)  
**Duration**: ~85 minutes
**Knowledge Graph Entries**: 16 tracked activities

## üéØ Session Objectives Achieved

### Primary Goal
‚úÖ **Configure slash commands to work properly with context-aware tracking**

### Secondary Goals  
‚úÖ **Identify instance segmentation approach**  
‚úÖ **Solve tracking automation challenges**  
‚úÖ **Implement proper Claude Code integration**

## üîç Key Discoveries

### 1. Claude Code Architecture Insight
- **Discovery**: `.claude/` directory files are NOT automatically loaded by instances
- **Impact**: Custom tracking protocols need explicit integration via supported mechanisms
- **Solution**: Slash commands provide proper integration path

### 2. Context Mismatch Problem
- **Issue**: Islamic-specific tracking applied to general development session
- **Root Cause**: Lack of proper instance segmentation
- **Resolution**: Context-switching slash commands for mode selection

### 3. Instance Segmentation Architecture
- **Current Instance**: Interactive Shell Mode (general development)
- **Available Instances**: Islamic research, Graphiti operations, software engineering
- **Proper Approach**: Specialized slash commands rather than file-based configuration
