Wed Jul 16 05:05:37 UTC 2025: SESSION START: claude-md-review-session - User requested review of global CLAUDE.md configuration and demonstration of Graphiti session tracking
Wed Jul 16 05:05:42 UTC 2025: DISCOVERY: Global CLAUDE.md contains Interactive Shell Mode configuration with Islamic text analysis capabilities, knowledge graph integration, and project tracking commands. Neo4j and Claude Docker API currently not running.
Wed Jul 16 05:09:30 UTC 2025: SLASH COMMANDS CONFIGURED: Created 13 new slash commands for Graphiti workflow integration - /gr, /gs, /gt, /gst, /pstart, /pend, /pdecision, /pfeature, /pproblem, /pcode, /psearch, /poverview, /claude2
Wed Jul 16 05:11:14 UTC 2025: AUTOMATIC TRACKING IMPLEMENTED: Added comprehensive auto-tracking protocols to project CLAUDE.md - Session lifecycle, Islamic text analysis, research decisions, code changes, problem resolution, and knowledge discovery now automated
Wed Jul 16 05:11:19 UTC 2025: CODE CHANGE: CLAUDE.md - Added automatic knowledge graph tracking protocols with Islamic text research specialization and 6 automation categories
Wed Jul 16 05:13:58 UTC 2025: INSIGHT: User identified context mismatch - automatic tracking configured for Islamic research but current session is general development/configuration work, not Islamic text analysis
Wed Jul 16 05:17:48 UTC 2025: DEVELOPMENT: Context-aware tracking implementation - Updated project CLAUDE.md for universal context detection and created specialized Islamic research tracking - Enables proper instance segmentation
Wed Jul 16 05:17:54 UTC 2025: CODE CHANGE: CLAUDE.md - Converted Islamic-specific tracking to context-aware universal tracking with development/research/operations contexts
Wed Jul 16 05:17:59 UTC 2025: CODE CHANGE: .claude/islamic-research-tracking.md - Created specialized Islamic research tracking protocol for Islamic text analysis instances with manuscript, hadith, Quranic, and Arabic NLP tracking
Wed Jul 16 05:20:30 UTC 2025: INSIGHT: Claude Code configuration analysis - .claude directory files like islamic-research-tracking.md are NOT automatically loaded by instances. Only CLAUDE.md and settings files are processed automatically. Custom tracking protocols need explicit integration.
Wed Jul 16 05:23:38 UTC 2025: DEVELOPMENT: Context-aware slash commands implementation - Created 7 specialized tracking commands: /islamic-mode, /dev-mode, /graphiti-mode, /track-islamic, /track-dev, /track-graphiti, /track-insight - Enables proper instance segmentation
Wed Jul 16 05:23:44 UTC 2025: CODE CHANGE: .claude/commands/ - Added 7 context-switching slash commands for proper tracking segmentation between development, Islamic research, and Graphiti operations modes
Wed Jul 16 05:23:50 UTC 2025: INSIGHT: Specialized slash commands solve instance segmentation problem - Context-specific tracking via commands rather than file-based configuration aligns with Claude Code architecture - Enables mode switching within single instance
Wed Jul 16 05:25:03 UTC 2025: SESSION END: development - Successfully implemented context-aware slash commands system with 7 specialized tracking modes - Committed changes as claude2 with comprehensive documentation - Push failed due to authentication but local commit complete
Wed Jul 16 05:28:19 UTC 2025: SESSION END: development - Context-aware slash commands implementation complete - Created 7 specialized tracking modes with proper Claude Code integration - Solved instance segmentation problem using slash command architecture - All changes committed as claude2
