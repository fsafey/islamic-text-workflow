  description = 'In "Al-Shia Hum Ahl Al-Sunnah," Muhammad al-Tijani al-Samawi analyzes the foundational sources of Islam to demonstrate Shia orthodoxy. Al-Tijani systematically argues that Shia Islam represents the authentic preservation of the Prophet''s *Sunnah*, while many contemporary Sunni practices constitute innovations (*bid''ah*) that deviate from original Islamic teachings. This thesis is built upon comparative analysis of ritual practices (*Salah*, *Hajj*, *Taharah*), theological foundations (*Tawhid*, *Nubuwwah*, *Ma''ad*), and legal methodology (*Usul al-Fiqh*). The work grounds its argument in critical examination of *Hadith al-Thaqalayn* and *Hadith al-Ghadir*, while systematically analyzing the varying responses of the Companions (*Sahaba*) to the Prophet''s explicit instructions regarding *Ahl al-Bayt*. Al-Tijani''s convert perspective enables him to serve as a scholarly bridge between traditions, offering a methodologically rigorous apologetic framework that challenges sectarian assumptions and advocates for Islamic unity based on shared prophetic guidance.'
