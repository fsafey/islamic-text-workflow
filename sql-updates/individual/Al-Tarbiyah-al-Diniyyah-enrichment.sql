  description = 'In "Al-Tarbiyah al-Diniyyah," Dr. Abdul Hadi al-Fadli analyzes the systematic development of pedagogical frameworks for effective Islamic religious education and moral formation. Al-Fadli systematically argues that Islamic education requires comprehensive pedagogical approaches integrating spiritual, intellectual, and moral dimensions of human development, demonstrating this through synthesis of classical Islamic educational principles (*Tarbiyah*) with contemporary pedagogical theory. This thesis is built upon three methodological pillars: theoretical foundations examining Quranic pedagogy and Prophetic educational methods (*Manhaj Nabawi*), practical pedagogical methodology addressing the role of the Islamic educator (*Mu''allim*), and contemporary applications integrating traditional wisdom with modern educational contexts. The work grounds its argument in detailed analysis of developmental psychology and learning theories, while systematically addressing curriculum development for Quranic studies, Islamic jurisprudence (*Fiqh*), and character education (*Akhlaq*). Al-Fadli''s comprehensive approach transforms this work into an essential resource for Islamic educators, offering a rigorous framework that bridges classical Islamic educational tradition with contemporary pedagogical innovation to serve modern religious educational needs.'
