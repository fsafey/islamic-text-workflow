    description = 'Dawr al-Shiah fi Bina al-Hadarah (The Role of Shia in Building Civilization) is a comprehensive historical-apologetic compendium by prominent Shia marja Jaafar al-Subhani that systematically documents and vindicates Shia Islam_s foundational contributions to Islamic civilization across intellectual, scientific, and cultural domains. Through systematic historical documentation integrated with biographical evaluation, the work demonstrates how Shia scholars have been instrumental but historically underrecognized architects of Islamic civilization, with their contributions often misattributed to other schools. Covering contributions from the foundational period through the contemporary era, the work examines Shia achievements in theology (kalam), jurisprudence (fiqh), philosophy, linguistics, natural sciences, mathematics, medicine, and mysticism (irfan). Al-Subhani employs a contemporary Twelver Shia marja_iyyah perspective that emphasizes historical vindication and intellectual legitimacy while correcting sectarian biases in traditional Islamic intellectual history. This work represents a significant contribution to modern Shia intellectual discourse, serving both as comprehensive historical documentation and contemporary apologetic defense of Shia Islam_s civilizational achievements.'
