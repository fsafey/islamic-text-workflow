  description = 'A comprehensive legal and theological examination of the rights of Ahl al-Bayt (the Prophets family) as established in the Quran and Sunnah. This authoritative work by Samaht al-Allamah Muhammad Husayn al-Haj al-Amili provides systematic analysis of the scriptural foundations for the special status, rights, and privileges accorded to the family of Prophet Muhammad in Islamic law and theology. Through detailed examination of Quranic verses and authentic prophetic traditions, the book establishes the legal and religious framework for understanding the unique position of Ahl al-Bayt in Islamic society. The work addresses various aspects including inheritance rights, religious authority, social status, and spiritual significance of the Prophetic family. The author employs rigorous methodology in hadith analysis and Quranic interpretation to demonstrate how Islamic scripture explicitly defines and protects the rights of the Prophets household. This scholarly treatise serves as both a legal reference for Islamic jurisprudence and a theological exposition of the continuing significance of Ahl al-Bayt in Islamic thought and practice. Essential for Islamic legal studies, Shia theology, and understanding the scriptural basis for Prophetic family rights.'
