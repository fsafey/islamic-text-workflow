    description = 'A comprehensive treatise on Islamic social defense mechanisms by contemporary Iraqi scholar and religious leader Jalal ad-Din Ali As-Saghir. This work systematically examines how Islamic principles provide comprehensive frameworks for community protection against contemporary threats including cultural invasion, economic exploitation, and social fragmentation. Drawing from Quranic injunctions and Prophetic traditions, the author develops practical strategies for Islamic communities to maintain religious identity and social cohesion while engaging with modern challenges. The work addresses institutional fortification through waqf systems, educational strengthening through Islamic institutions, and social solidarity through zakat and community networks. Particularly relevant for Muslim communities navigating globalization pressures while preserving Islamic values and identity. The author''s background as both religious scholar and political figure provides unique perspective on addressing both spiritual and temporal aspects of social defense in contemporary Islamic societies.'
