  description = 'A comprehensive examination of the concept and practice of jihad within Shia Islamic tradition and history. This important work by Samira Mukhtar al-Laythi analyzes the theological foundations, historical applications, and contemporary relevance of jihad from a distinctly Shia perspective. The book explores how Shia Muslims have understood and practiced various forms of jihad, including defensive warfare, spiritual struggle, and resistance against oppression throughout Islamic history. Through detailed analysis of Shia jurisprudence, historical precedents, and theological principles, the work demonstrates the unique characteristics of Shia approaches to jihad compared to other Islamic schools of thought. The author examines both the greater jihad (spiritual struggle against the self) and the lesser jihad (physical defense and resistance) as understood within Shia theology and practice. The book likely addresses the role of the Imams in defining legitimate jihad, the conditions for defensive warfare, and the Shia understanding of resistance against unjust authority. This scholarly work serves as both an academic study of Shia military and spiritual doctrine and a practical guide for understanding how Shia communities have historically defended their faith and rights. Essential for Islamic military history, Shia theology, and understanding religious approaches to conflict and resistance.'
