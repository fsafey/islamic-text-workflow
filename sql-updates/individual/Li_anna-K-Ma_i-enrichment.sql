  description = 'In "Li''anna K Ma''i," Dr. Ahmad Ziad Mohibak analyzes the theological and philosophical foundations for divine presence and companionship in Islamic thought. Mohibak systematically argues that divine accompaniment (*Ma''iyyah*) represents a fundamental aspect of the believer''s spiritual journey, demonstrating this through integrated rational argumentation (*Aql*) and scriptural evidence (*Naql*). This thesis is built upon comprehensive analysis of three methodological pillars: philosophical reasoning examining divine attributes (*Sifat*), Quranic exegesis of key verses on divine presence (Al-Hadid 57:4, At-Tawbah 9:40), and integration of classical theological perspectives from Ash''ari, Mu''tazila, and mystical traditions. The work grounds its argument in detailed analysis of prophetic traditions (*Hadith Qudsi*) emphasizing divine proximity (*Qurb*), while systematically addressing contemporary challenges to belief in divine omnipresence (*Ihata*). Mohibak''s analytical approach transforms this work into a bridge between classical Islamic theology and contemporary philosophical inquiry, offering a rigorous framework for understanding divine-human relationship that addresses both intellectual skepticism and spiritual seeking in modern Islamic thought.'
